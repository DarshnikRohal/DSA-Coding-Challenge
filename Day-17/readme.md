# ðŸš€ Day 17 â€“ Min Stack & Two Sum ðŸ“‰âž•

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Focused on two important and frequently asked problems involving stacks and hash maps.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Min Stack
- **Task:** Implement a stack that supports `push`, `pop`, `top`, and retrieving the minimum in constant time.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used a second stack (`minStack`) to keep track of minimums.  
  - Synced `minStack` with the main stack.
- **Complexity:** O(1) time for all operations

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Two Sum
- **Task:** Find indices of two numbers that add up to a target.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used a hash map to store seen values and their indices.  
  - Checked complement on-the-fly.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Auxiliary stacks can enhance stack functionality.
- Hash maps are great for single-pass search problems.
