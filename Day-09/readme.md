# ðŸš€ Day 9 â€“ Swapping Nodes & Nth Digit ðŸ”„ðŸ”¢

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Worked on precision pointer control and a smart math problem involving digit sequences.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Swapping Nodes in a Linked List
- **Task:** Swap the k-th node from the start with the k-th node from the end.
- **Approach:**  
  - Found both nodes in separate traversals.
  - Swapped their values (safer than adjusting links).
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Nth Digit
- **Task:** Find the n-th digit in the infinite sequence 123456789101112...
- **Approach:**  
  - Determined the digit length range the number falls in.
  - Located the exact number and extracted the digit.
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(log n), Space: O(1)

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Swapping node values avoids complex pointer rewiring.
- The digit sequence problem tests number manipulation and pattern recognition.
