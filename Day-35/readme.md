# ðŸš€ Day 35 â€“ Binary Tree Ancestors & String Segments ðŸŒ³ðŸ§µ

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Solved a fundamental recursive tree problem and a string parsing task focused on whitespace handling.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree
- **Task:** Find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in a binary tree.
- **Approach:**  
  - Applied **recursive DFS traversal**.  
  - If both left and right subtrees return non-null, current node is LCA.  
  - If only one side is non-null, return that up the recursive chain.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(h) space (recursion stack)

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Number of Segments in a String
- **Task:** Count the number of non-empty words in a string separated by spaces.
- **Approach:**  
  - Iterated through the string.  
  - Counted a new segment when a **non-space character** follows a space or string start.  
  - Ignored multiple consecutive spaces.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- The LCA problem is a foundational example of **recursive tree analysis**.  
- String segmentation problems are easy to miscount without **careful condition checks**.
