# 🚀 Day 25 – Stack via Queues & Array Rotations 🔁🧮

## 📚 What I Solved Today

Focused on simulating stack behavior using queues and rotating arrays in-place.

---

### 🧠 Problem 1: Implement Stack using Queues
- **Task:** Design a stack using standard queue operations.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used two queues for `push` and `pop` logic.  
  - Optimized with a single queue by rotating elements after each push.
- **Complexity:** O(1) for push, O(n) for pop/top

---

### 🧠 Problem 2: Rotate Array
- **Task:** Rotate an array right by `k` steps.
- **Approach:**  
  - Reversal technique:  
    - Reverse entire array  
    - Reverse first `k` elements  
    - Reverse the rest
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Queues can mimic stack behavior with clever ordering.
- Reversal method is a clean way to rotate arrays in-place.
