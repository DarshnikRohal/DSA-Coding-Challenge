# ðŸš€ Day 24 â€“ Valid Parentheses Length & Binary Search ðŸŽ¯ðŸ§®

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Focused on optimizing well-formed substrings and binary searching insertion points.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Longest Valid Parentheses
- **Task:** Return the length of the longest valid parentheses substring.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used a **stack** to store indices.  
  - Also tried two-pass counter approach for O(1) space.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) or O(1) space depending on approach

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Search Insert Position
- **Task:** Find the index to insert a target number in a sorted array.
- **Approach:**  
  - Applied classic **binary search**.  
  - Adjusted boundaries based on comparisons.
- **Complexity:** O(log n) time, O(1) space

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Parentheses problems often involve indexing tricks or two-pass logic.
- Binary search is ideal for sorted-array lookups and insertions.
