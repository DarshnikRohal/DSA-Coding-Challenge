# ðŸš€ Day 36 â€“ Tree Path Sums & Vowel Reversal ðŸŒ³ðŸ”„ðŸ”¡

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Worked on calculating path-based values in trees and used two-pointer logic for string manipulation.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Sum Root to Leaf Numbers
- **Task:** Each path from root to leaf forms a number. Return the **sum** of all such numbers.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used **recursive DFS** with a running sum.  
  - At each node: `currentSum = currentSum * 10 + node->val`  
  - On reaching a leaf, added `currentSum` to total.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(h) space (due to recursion stack)

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Reverse Vowels of a String
- **Task:** Reverse only the vowels in a string, keeping other characters unchanged.
- **Approach:**  
  - Implemented **two-pointer** approach.  
  - Moved pointers inward, swapping vowels found on both ends.  
  - Used a set of vowels for quick lookup.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Recursive tree problems often involve carrying state through function parameters.  
- Two-pointer techniques can simplify **in-place transformations** significantly.
