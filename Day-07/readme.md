# ðŸš€ Day 7 â€“ Rotate List & Plus One ðŸ”„âž•

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Practiced edge case handling and efficient list manipulation â€” from rotating linked lists to simulating digit-wise math operations.

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Rotate List
- **Task:** Rotate a linked list to the right by k places.
- **Approach:**  
  - Counted the number of nodes.
  - Connected tail to head to form a circular list.
  - Broke the cycle at the (length - k % length) node.
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Plus One
- **Task:** Add one to a number represented as a list of digits.
- **Approach:**  
  - Iterated from the end, handled carry.
  - If overflow (e.g., 999), prepended `1` to the list.
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(n), Space: O(1) or O(n) if new digit is added

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Converting a linked list into a cycle and breaking it at the right point is an elegant rotation trick.
- Always handle edge cases like overflow (e.g., 999 â†’ 1000) in digit array problems.
