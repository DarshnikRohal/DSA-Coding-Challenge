# ðŸš€ Day 39 â€“ BST Insertion & String Deduplication ðŸŒ²ðŸ§¹

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Practiced maintaining BST structure during insertion and used stack logic to clean up strings with adjacent duplicates.

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Insert into a Binary Search Tree
- **Task:** Insert a given value into a BST such that the BST properties remain intact.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used **recursive insertion** strategy.  
  - Compared current nodeâ€™s value with target:  
    - If less, insert into left subtree.  
    - If greater, insert into right subtree.  
  - Created and returned a new node when reaching a null child.
- **Complexity:** O(h) time, where h is the tree height

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String
- **Task:** Repeatedly remove adjacent duplicate characters from a string until no more can be removed.
- **Approach:**  
  - Utilized a **stack-like approach** with a result string.  
  - If the current character matched the last character in result, removed the last character.  
  - Else, added the character to the result.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Recursive thinking is essential for clean and readable **tree operations**.  
- Stack-based solutions are intuitive and efficient for **string cleanup problems** involving reversals or undo operations.
