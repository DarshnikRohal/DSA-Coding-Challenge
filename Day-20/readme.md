# ðŸš€ Day 20 â€“ Reverse Polish Evaluation & GCD Finder ðŸ”„âž—

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Tackled expression parsing and number theory using stacks and GCD logic.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
- **Task:** Evaluate postfix expressions (RPN) like `["2", "1", "+", "3", "*"]`.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used a **stack** to push operands.  
  - Popped two values and computed on encountering an operator.  
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array
- **Task:** Return GCD of smallest and largest array elements.
- **Approach:**  
  - Found `min` and `max` of array.  
  - Applied Euclidean algorithm for GCD.
- **Complexity:** O(log(max)) time

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Stacks are essential for expression-based evaluation.
- GCD is a classic and efficient solution for reducing problems in number theory.
