# ðŸš€ Day 26 â€“ Binary Search and Maximum Subarrays ðŸ”ŽðŸ“ˆ

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Dived into range searching with binary search and dynamic programming on subarrays.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
- **Task:** Return the first and last index of a target value.
- **Approach:**  
  - Two binary searches:  
    - First for lower bound  
    - Second for upper bound
- **Complexity:** O(log n) time

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Maximum Subarray
- **Task:** Find the contiguous subarray with the largest sum.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used **Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm**  
  - Tracked running max and global max
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Binary search can efficiently locate value ranges in sorted arrays.
- Kadaneâ€™s Algorithm is optimal for max-sum subarray problems.
