# 🚀 Day 16 – Delete Node in List & Sum of Squares ❌➗

## 📚 What I Solved Today

Learned a neat trick to delete a node without the head and solved a number theory-based two-pointer problem.

---

### 🧠 Problem 1: Delete Node in a Linked List
- **Task:** Delete a node without access to the head pointer.
- **Approach:**  
  - Copied data from the next node to current node.
  - Deleted the next node.
- **Complexity:** O(1) time, O(1) space

---

### 🧠 Problem 2: Sum of Square Numbers
- **Task:** Check if a number can be expressed as the sum of squares of two integers.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used two-pointer approach from 0 and sqrt(c).
  - Checked `a^2 + b^2 == c`.
- **Complexity:** O(√n) time, O(1) space
