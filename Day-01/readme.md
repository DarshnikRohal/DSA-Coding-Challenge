# ðŸš€ Day 1 â€“ Reverse Linked List & Missing Number ðŸ”¢

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Starting the challenge with two foundational problems on **LeetCode** that test core understanding of arrays and linked lists.

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Reverse Linked List
- Reverse a singly linked list in-place.
- Classic linked list manipulation question.

### ðŸ’¡ Approach
- Used the **iterative three-pointer method**.
- Tracked `prev`, `curr`, and `next` to reverse node links one by one.
- Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Missing Number
- Given `n` distinct numbers from 0 to n, find the missing one.

### ðŸ’¡ Approach
- **Mathematical method**: Calculate expected sum `n*(n+1)/2`, subtract the sum of the array to get the missing number.
- Also explored **XOR approach** for constant space and optimal performance.
- Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Linked lists require precise pointer handling.
- Mathematical patterns (sum, XOR) help reduce space/time in array problems.
- A strong foundation is key to tackling advanced DSA topics.
