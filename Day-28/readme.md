# ðŸš€ Day 28 â€“ Binary Tree Problems & LCM-based Subarrays ðŸŒ³âž—

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Worked on binary tree traversal and advanced subarray enumeration using LCM logic.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Minimum Depth of Binary Tree
- **Task:** Find the shortest distance from root to the nearest leaf.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used **BFS** to explore level-by-level and returned when first leaf was found.  
  - Also implemented DFS with base case checks for null children.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(n) space

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Number of Subarrays with LCM Equal to K
- **Task:** Count number of subarrays whose LCM equals `k`.
- **Approach:**  
  - Brute-force with nested loop for all subarrays.  
  - Used `__gcd` function to compute LCM efficiently.  
  - Broke early if LCM exceeded `k`.
- **Complexity:** Worst-case O(nÂ²), optimized with pruning

---

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- BFS provides optimal early exit for shortest paths in trees.
- LCM-based subarray problems require careful brute-force and math optimization.
