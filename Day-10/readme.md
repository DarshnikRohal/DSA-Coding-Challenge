# ðŸš€ Day 10 â€“ Delete Middle Node & Bulb Switcher ðŸ’¡ðŸ“‰

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Wrapped up the 10-day milestone with a clean list deletion problem and a brilliant math-based toggle puzzle!

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Delete Middle Node of a Linked List
- **Task:** Delete the middle node of a singly linked list.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used slow and fast pointer approach to find the middle.
  - Removed the middle node by skipping it.
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(n), Space: O(1)

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Bulb Switcher
- **Task:** Find out how many bulbs are on after n rounds of toggling.
- **Approach:**  
  - Observed that bulbs with an odd number of divisors stay on.
  - These are perfect squares â†’ result = floor(sqrt(n)).
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(1), Space: O(1)

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Middle-node deletion is a great use of fast-slow pointer technique.
- Mathematical insight can reduce a seemingly complex problem to a single formula.
