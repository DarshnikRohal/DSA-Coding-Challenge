# 🚀 Day 23 – Zero Shifts & Basic Calculation ➡️➕➖

## 📚 What I Solved Today

Worked on a classic array manipulation problem and a basic arithmetic expression parser.

---

### 🧠 Problem 1: Move Zeroes
- **Task:** Move all zeroes to the end while maintaining order of non-zero elements.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used a two-pointer technique.  
  - Swapped non-zero values forward, then filled trailing space with zeroes.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(1) space

---

### 🧠 Problem 2: Basic Calculator
- **Task:** Evaluate arithmetic expressions with `+`, `-`, `(`, `)`.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used a **stack** to maintain running totals and signs.  
  - Handled nested expressions recursively or iteratively.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time and space

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Array problems often benefit from clean pointer-based logic.
- Expression evaluation is a textbook use case for stacks.
