# ðŸš€ Day 27 â€“ Binary Tree Traversal & Path Sum ðŸŒ³ðŸ§ 

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Explored recursive and iterative tree traversals along with path-based sum verification.

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
- **Task:** Return inorder traversal (left-root-right).
- **Approach:**  
  - Recursive DFS.  
  - Also implemented iterative version using stack.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(h) space (h = tree height)

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Path Sum
- **Task:** Determine if there exists a root-to-leaf path that equals a given sum.
- **Approach:**  
  - Recursive DFS: Subtract node value from target and recurse.  
  - Return true if a leaf node matches the remaining sum.
- **Complexity:** O(n) time, O(h) space

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Mastering both recursive and iterative tree traversals is key.  
- DFS with subtraction simplifies root-to-leaf path checks.
