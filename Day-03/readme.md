# ðŸš€ Day 3 â€“ Merge Two Sorted Lists & Perfect Number ðŸ”—ðŸ’¯

## ðŸ“š What I Solved Today

Balanced between linked list manipulation and a number theory classic.

### ðŸ§  Problem 1: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
- **Task:** Merge two sorted singly linked lists into one sorted list.
- **Approach:**  
  - Used a **dummy node** and iterated through both lists.
  - Also implemented the **recursive** approach for clean logic.
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(n + m), Space: O(1) iterative / O(n + m) recursive

---

### ðŸ§  Problem 2: Perfect Number
- **Task:** Check if a number is equal to the sum of its positive divisors (excluding itself).
- **Approach:**  
  - Iterate up to `sqrt(n)` and add divisor pairs to the sum.
  - Skip adding the number itself.
- **Complexity:**  
  - Time: O(âˆšn), Space: O(1)

## ðŸ§  Key Takeaways

- Dummy nodes simplify linked list problems significantly.
- Efficient divisor calculation techniques are essential in number theory questions.
